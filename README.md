#Bike-Powered Sign Project

The ELSOC Design and Development Group is a collection of students collaboratively working on projects to demonstrate the ablities of Electrical Engineering students at UNSW.

This project is a Bike-Powered Sign, that uses a generator and battery management system to power an EE&T LED display, whilst also providing a display of measurable metrics. It is also able to charge your phone!
